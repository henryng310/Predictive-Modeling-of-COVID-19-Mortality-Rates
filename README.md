# Predictive-Modeling-of-COVID-19-Mortality-Rates

The goal of this project is to use linear modeling to predict two weeks ahead the number of daily COVID deaths in different countries using a range of factors.


Using the data found on: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data Their complete dataset contains a lot of information including the number of deaths, cases, vaccinations, hospitalizations, and several other country-specific pieces of information relevant to understanding the effects of COVID.

Using population estimates found from: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/population-estimates-and-projections Population ages 80 and above for female, Population ages 80 and above for male, as well as total population.


3 steps for this project: Data wrangling, Linear modeling, and Evaluating the linear models.
